    <h1>KEEP CALM AND ACT NORMAL</h1>
    <p>During the next 5 minutes, everyone else will be trying to take photos of<p>
    <p>the other contestants without them looking into the camera.</p>
    <p>You will need to pretend to do this as well so they donâ€™t suspect that you have a SECRET TASK.</p>
    <p>Your task is to lay down on the ground for 30 seconds without the other contestants calling you out on it. Success gets you 5 points.</p>
