    <h1>KEEP CALM AND ACT NORMAL</h1>
    <p>During the next 10 minutes, everyone else will be trying to take photos of<p>
    <p>the other contestants without them looking into the camera.</p>
    <p>You will need to pretend to do this as well so they donâ€™t suspect that you have a SECRET TASK.</p>
    <p>If you take any photos, you get zero points.</p>
    <p>Don't let them discover you are not taking any photos.</p>
    <p>Your task is to get the other contestants to say your secret word as many times as possible.</p>
    <p>Your secret word is: ZOOM</p>
